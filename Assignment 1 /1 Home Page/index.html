                    I can't wait to do work with you! I am located in Cincinnati, Ohio and I've been shooting
                    professional sports since 2017.
                    I grew up playing sports and ballin has always been my passion. After a few injuries and two moves
                    across the country, I have kept my passion for sport by taking photographs. I love being able to
                    travel to new stadiums and capture the emotions of the game.</th>
